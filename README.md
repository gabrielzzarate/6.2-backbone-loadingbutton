# 6.2-backbone-loadingbutton

Using a Backbone collection, build a loading button. The loading button should fetch the collection when clicked, become disabled when you click on it and change its text to "Loading..." and then return to its normal state after the collection is finished being fetched.

The loading button should change its text while the collection is being fetched. After the fetch is finished, the collection of items should be added to a list in the DOM.
